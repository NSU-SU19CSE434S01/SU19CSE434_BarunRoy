**Description:**

In this project I performed automated functional testing on a website naming http://automationpractice.com/index.php using selenium server - 3.9.1. This website is an e-commerce website where they sell all kinds of female dresses and shoes. I tested the title, logo, sign in, contact us and the full buying process of a product that is summary, address, shipping and payment.
